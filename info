Sure, here is a detailed explanation followed by the requested playbook:

### Steps to Automate the Task

1. **Ensure the `dev` group exists:**
   - Check if the `dev` group already exists.
   - Create the `dev` group if it doesn't exist.

2. **Ensure the `sam` user exists and is added to the `dev` group:**
   - Check if the `sam` user already exists.
   - Create the `sam` user and add it to the `dev` group if it doesn't exist.

3. **Install required packages (`python3` and `git`):**
   - Ensure the `python3` and `git` packages are installed on the machine.

4. **Verify Ansible command is recognized on the control machine:**
   - Check if Ansible is installed and install it if not present.

5. **Set up inventory file correctly:**
   - Ensure the inventory file is correctly set up with the target servers.

6. **Verify `sudo` permission:**
   - Ensure you have `sudo` permission for automation tasks.

7. **Test playbook in a controlled environment:**
   - Test the playbook in a controlled environment before wide deployment.

8. **Verify SSH access to managed machines:**
   - Ensure SSH access to the managed machines is not blocked by the firewall or iptables.

### Playbook

Below is an Ansible playbook that accomplishes each task in a separate function (task), following best practices.

```yaml
---
- name: Setup dev group, create user sam, and install packages
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure 'dev' group exists
      ansible.builtin.group:
        name: dev
        state: present

    - name: Ensure 'sam' user exists and is added to 'dev' group
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: sam
        groups: dev
        state: present

    - name: Install python3 package
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: python3
        state: present

    - name: Install git package
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: git
        state: present
```

### Additional Tasks on the Control Machine

1. **Verify Ansible Installation:**

   ```bash
   # Check if Ansible is installed
   ansible --version

   # If Ansible is not installed, install it using the following command
   sudo yum install ansible -y
   ```

2. **Setup Inventory File:**

   Create an inventory file (`inventory.ini`) with the target servers:

   ```ini
   [all]
   server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101 ansible_user=root
   server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102 ansible_user=root
   ```

3. **Verify SSH Access:**

   Ensure you have SSH access to the managed machines:

   ```bash
   ssh root@192.168.1.101
   ssh root@192.168.1.102
   ```

### Verification

Before wide deployment, test the playbook in a controlled environment:

1. **Run the Playbook:**

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
   ```

2. **Verify the Tasks:**

   - Check if the `dev` group is created.
   - Check if the `sam` user is created and added to the `dev` group.
   - Verify the installation of `python3` and `git` packages.

By following these steps and using the provided playbook, you can automate the required tasks across your CentOS machines efficiently.
