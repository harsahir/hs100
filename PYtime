In the script provided, the methods of the PyTimer class are called in the following order:

__init__ method:

Called when the t1 object is created with t1 = PyTimer(2, 0).
This initializes the minute and second attributes of t1.
times_up method:

Called repeatedly within the while loop condition while t1.times_up() != True:.
This checks if both minute and second are zero, indicating that the timer has finished.
__sub__ method:

Called by the expression t1 - 1 inside the while loop.
This attempts to subtract 1 second from the t1 objectâ€™s current time.
display_time method:

Called by the line print(t1.display_time()) inside the while loop.
This formats the current minute and second values as a string and returns it for printing.
time.sleep(1) function:

Although not a method of the PyTimer class, this function is called to pause the execution for 1 second before the next iteration of the loop.
