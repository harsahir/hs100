__init__ method:

This is the first thing that runs when you create a timer (t1). It sets up the minutes and seconds.
times_up method:

Before each loop, this checks if the time has run out (if both minutes and seconds are zero).
__sub__ method:

This is where the timer subtracts one second from the remaining time.
display_time method:

This shows the current time left on the timer in the format of minutes and seconds.
time.sleep(1):

This pauses the program for one second before it subtracts another second and shows the new time.
