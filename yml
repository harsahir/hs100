Based on the commands and information provided, here are the most logical answers for each blank:

Blank 1: 142.23.110.7
Explanation: This is the IP address used in the SSH command.

Blank 2: ansible_user=arnold
Explanation: Since arnold is the user being SSH'd into, it would be the Ansible user defined in the inventory file.

Blank 3: next
Explanation: The hosts in the Ansible playbook usually refer to a group or host specified in the inventory file. "next" appears to be a host defined in the ~/oldfiles/hosts file.

Blank 4: arnold
Explanation: The user field in the playbook should match the user used in the SSH command, which is arnold.

Blank 5: yes
Explanation: The become parameter is typically a boolean indicating whether to use privilege escalation (e.g., sudo). yes is the common value used.

Blank 6: ~/oldfiles/hosts
Explanation: This is the path to the inventory file used in the Ansible playbook command, matching the content from the cat command.

So, the final answers are:

Blank 1: 142.23.110.7
Blank 2: ansible_user=arnold
Blank 3: next
Blank 4: arnold
Blank 5: yes
Blank 6: ~/oldfiles/hosts
